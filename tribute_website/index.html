            <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
                centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.
                His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
                His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
                Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar
                traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in
                coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
                trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the
                mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the
                family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home.</p>
